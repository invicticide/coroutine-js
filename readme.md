# coroutine-js

This is a demonstration of a simple nestable coroutine implementation in TypeScript/JavaScript.

Build output is already included in `dist/` but you can also do `npm run build` to rebuild everything. Look at `build.js` for the build script; it wraps the TypeScript invocation and copies assets (e.g. the `index.html`).

Launch `dist/index.html` to view the demo.
